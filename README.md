# discourse-dice

A theme component that allows users to roll dice in their posts. For more information see [meta topic goes here].

### Modifiers

Currently implemented rolling modifiers include:

 - `+[N]` and `-[N]` - add or subtract a modifier from the result
 - `t[N]` - report pass/fail versus a threshold
 - `i` - report individual results instead of summing up
